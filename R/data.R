#' City neighborhoods by tract
#'
#' Datasets of neighborhoods for New Haven, Hartford/West Hartford, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Some tracts cross between more than one neighborhood; use `weight` column for aggregating values such as populations. Previously this included a block group version for New Haven, which I've removed; I'm also renaming `nhv_tracts` to `new_haven_tracts` for consistency.
#'
#' @format A data frame
#' \describe{
#'   \item{town}{For `hartford_tracts`, the name of the town, because both Hartford and West Hartford neighborhoods are included; otherwise, no `town` variable is needed}

#' Zip to town lookup
#'
#' A crosswalk of Connecticut's ZCTA5s, towns, and town GEOIDs with shares of households in overlapping areas. Each row corresponds to a combination of zip and town; therefore, some zips have more than one observation, as do towns.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 407 rows and 7 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{zip}{5-digit zip code (ZCTA5)}

#' School districts by town
#'
#' A crosswalk of Connecticut towns and school districts, including regional districts. Some very small towns don't operate their own schools and are not included here, whereas other towns are both part of a regional district and operate some of their own schools, most commonly their own elementary.
#'
#' Note that for aggregating by region, the Hartford-area regional district CREC is not included here, because it spans so many other towns that also run their own schools.CREC is of significant enough size that it should generally be included in Greater Hartford aggregations or as its own district for comparisons alongside e.g. Hartford and West Hartford.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 195 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{district}{School district name}

#' }
#' @source Distinct town-level district names come from the state's [data.world](https://data.world/state-of-connecticut/9k2y-kqxn). Regional districts and their towns come from combing through school district websites.
